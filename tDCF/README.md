ASV scores

Contains the name of the database it was from, the label (target, nontarget, spoof), and the score. The score is a log likelihood ratio, which is associated with the strength of two opposing hypothesis (target hypothesis and nontarget hypothesis). The higher the score, the stronger support for the target hypothesis. 
 


CM scores

Similar to ASV scores, but now with different labels (bonafide and spoof). The two hypothesis are now bonafide and spoof hypothesis, with stronger support for bonafide the higher the score.
